            <li>Pasta water of Pasta that is almost finished cooking</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients for the Salmon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300 grams of Salmon fillet</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons of Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Some Thyme</li>
            <li>Some smoked paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Before anything heat up the airfryer to 200 째C or 400째F and roast the raw and unsalted Cashew nuts for around 4-5 minutes. <strong>(check so you don't burn them)</strong></p>

        <h3>Prepare the Salmon</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the Airfyer to 200 째C or 400 째F.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil, thyme, smoked paprika, salt and pepper into a bowl. Crush the garlic cloves with a garlic press or grate the garlic and add them too. Mix everything.</li>
            <li>Put the Salmon on the Crisper Plate inside the Airfyer and brush the whole mix inside the bowl onto it.</li>
            <li>Set the Airfryer to 13 minutes and let it cook for that duration. Meanwhile prepare the Pesto Pasta.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Prepare the Pesto Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the Basil leafs.</li>
            <li>Crush the Garlic cloves or grate them.</li>
            <li>Add everything from the Pesto Pasta ingredients list into a small mixer and let it mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Follow the cooking steps on the packaging of the pasta of your choice (Penne or Spaghetti are my favourite choices).</li>
            <li>Right before the Pasta finishes to cook take out around 100-200ml of Pasta water (depends how creamy you want it) and add it to the mixer with the Pesto inside.</li>
            <li>Let the Mixer mix the Pesto again for around a minute and add the Pesto to the Pasta (that you have drained) and mix.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Put the Pasta and the Salmon on a plate and grate more Parmegiano Reggiano on top of the pasta.</p>
        <p><strong>ENJOY!</strong></p>
